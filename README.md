Bajan Panjshiri and my email is bpanjshiri@my.waketech.edu
This is a github I have just created for the sole purpose learning how to clone and open a new repository.
The repository contains my name and email along side with the purpose of why it was created.
I downloaded github on the desktop allowing me to clone the repository to my folders in my hard drive by using the application.
